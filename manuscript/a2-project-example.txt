# Project example {#app-project-example}

Setting up project with JPA, Querydsl and H2 as a database may seem daunting task for a newcomer,
but it's not really that difficult. We will show how it works in Maven. I'm a fan of Gradle too,
but -- unfortunately -- more a fan than an experienced user and "instant" solutions readily
available for Maven are not yet prepared for Gradle.

%% Reference documentation, show entity example and generated class perhaps?
